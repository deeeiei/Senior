# Tankbot: Weld Seam Tracking Robot

This repository contains the source code for my senior/capstone project, which focuses on developing a TurtleBot-based robotic system for weld seam tracking. The system uses sensor data processing and ROS 2 nodes to detect a simulated weld seam and control the robot motion along the target path.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to develop an autonomous weld seam tracking system using a mobile robot platform. The robot is designed to detect the position of a weld seam and adjust its movement based on the detected seam location.

This project is part of my senior/capstone work and is intended to demonstrate the integration of:

- ROS 2-based robot control
- Sensor data processing
- Weld seam detection
- Motion control using velocity commands
- Data logging for testing and analysis

Main Components
1. Median Filter Package

The median_filter package is responsible for processing sensor data and reducing noise before seam detection. It helps improve the stability of the detected weld seam position.

Main file:

src/median_filter/median_filter/weld_detector_median.py
2. Seam Controller Package

The seam_controller package controls the motion of the robot based on the detected seam position. It includes PID control, velocity conversion, and logging nodes.

Main files:

src/seam_controller/seam_controller/pid_node.py
src/seam_controller/seam_controller/cmd_vel_to_motor.py
src/seam_controller/seam_controller/control_logger.py
src/seam_controller/seam_controller/tracking_logger.py
src/seam_controller/launch/system.launch.py
System Concept

The system works by detecting the weld seam position from sensor data. The detected position is then compared with the desired center position. The error is sent to a controller, which generates motion commands to adjust the robot's movement.

Requirements

This project is developed and tested with:

Raspberry Pi 5
ROS 2
Python 3
TurtleBot-based mobile robot platform
Sensor for seam detection, such as LiDAR or depth-related sensor
Installation

Clone this repository:

git clone https://github.com/deeeiei/Senior.git

Go to the project directory:

cd Senior

Build the ROS 2 workspace:

colcon build

Source the workspace:

source install/setup.bash
Running the System

To run the complete system using the launch file:

ros2 launch seam_controller system.launch.py

Alternatively, individual nodes can be run separately depending on the testing setup.

Example:

ros2 run median_filter weld_detector_median
ros2 run seam_controller pid_node
Notes

The build/, install/, and log/ folders are not included in this repository because they are generated automatically when building the ROS 2 workspace.

If the workspace is rebuilt, these folders will be created again by running:

colcon build
Project Status

This project is currently under development as part of my senior/capstone project. The current version focuses on basic weld seam detection, robot motion control, and experimental testing.

Future improvements may include:

Improving sensor accuracy
Upgrading from Raspberry Pi to NVIDIA Jetson
Testing with additional sensors such as TOF or TOFD-related sensors
Improving the robustness of the seam tracking algorithm
Adding more experimental results and performance evaluation
